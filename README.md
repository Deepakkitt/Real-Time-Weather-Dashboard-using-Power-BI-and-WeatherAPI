# Real-Time-Weather-Dashboard-using-Power-BI-and-WeatherAPI
This project integrates real-time weather data from a RESTful API into Power BI to build an interactive weather analytics dashboard. Using WeatherAPI, JSON data is extracted and modeled to visualize current weather, forecasts, and air quality indices across four major Indian cities: Kolkata, Chennai, Gujarat, and Lucknow.
